==================
Phantom Open Emoji is a completely free and open source set of emoji.

POE on Kickstarter
------------------
This project was started from a campaign on kickstarter at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/374397522/phantom-open-emoji .
Thanks to the support of our backers we've made it this far. We did not however receive enough funding to complete the set, but will attempt to do so with our emoji-as-a-service platform "emojidex".
